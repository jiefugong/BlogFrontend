## Hi, I'm Jeff!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer working at [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com/). I was previously on the Billing and Loans Data teams where I've built scalable, distributed data pipelines responsible for powering the company's complex financial infrastructure.

Just recently, I joined the [Debit+ Engineering team](https://www.affirm.com/debit) where I'll be building out the consumer experience for our new pay-over-time Debit card product.

Prior to Affirm, I worked at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) where I was focused on building out the company's internal transcoding solution. I also helped develop the proprietary ABR algorithm (A.K.A the [auto feature](https://medium.com/twitch-news/use-the-auto-quality-option-for-stress-free-streams-dc1f89024f2a)) that is available by default on all transcoded Twitch streams.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing with my 6 year old dog Riley, [DJ'ing](https://soundcloud.com/dj_ikstra) electronic music, and playing Valorant rather poorly.
