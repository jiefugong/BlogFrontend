## Hi, I'm Jeff!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer working at [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com/). At Affirm, I've worked on the Billing and Loans Data teams where I've built scalable, distributed data pipelines that process terabytes of data daily. This data is used to power core teams from underwriting to checkout to investor reporting.

Just recently, I joined the [Debit+ Engineering team](https://www.affirm.com/debit) where I'll be building out the experience interface for our new card product that integrates with our pay-over-time product.

Prior to Affirm, I worked at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) where I was focused on building out the company's internal transcoding solution. I also developed a proprietary ABR algorithm (A.K.A the [auto feature](https://medium.com/twitch-news/use-the-auto-quality-option-for-stress-free-streams-dc1f89024f2a)).

Outside of work, I enjoy playing with my 6 year old dog Riley, [DJ'ing](https://soundcloud.com/dj_ikstra) electronic music, and playing Valorant rather poorly.
